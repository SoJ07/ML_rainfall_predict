Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning
Rainfall Prediction is the application of meteorology and machine learning to predict the amount of rainfall over a region. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity and pre-planning of water structures.

Moreover, rainfall greatly affects human life in various sectors such as agriculture and transportation. Additionaly, it can cause natural disasters such as drought, floods, and landslides. The aim of this project is to build an accurate rainfall prediction model so that prescriptive measures can be made.

Governments, communities and individuals spend large amounts of money so that there is enough water available for everyone. Collecting and understanding rainfall data is important so that the right decisions are made.

Rainfall prediction has gained utmost research relevance in recent times due to its complexities and persistent applications such as flood forecasting and monitoring of pollutant concentration levels, among others. Existing models use complex statistical models that are often too costly, both computationally and budgetary, or are not applied to downstream applications. Therefore, approaches that use Machine Learning algorithms in conjunction with time-series data are being explored as an alternative to overcome these drawbacks.

The main objective of this project is to identify the relevant atmospheric features that cause rainfall and predict the intensity of daily rainfall using various machine learning algorithms such as Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Multilayer Perceptron Regressor (Neural Network), KNeighbors Regressor, Ridge Regression, Decission Tree,AdaBoost, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

In addition to, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics were used to measure the performance of the machine learning models.
